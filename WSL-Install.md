> <h2>Installing Docker</h2>

With WSL Microsoft, or docker rather has made it far easier than a manual install of Docker to something like Linux. It optionally requires Windows Subsystem for Linux, however offers better performance this way.

You can download it directly from their website and install it.

- [Docker Download](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe)


Run this and leave the box for "Run under WSL2 instead of hyper-v checked". unchecking this will have it run on the Hyper-V hypervisor.

After that, everything is complete!
